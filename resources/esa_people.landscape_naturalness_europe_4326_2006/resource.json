    "dc:comment" : "The landscape naturalness of Europe is represented in percentages with 100 as more naturalness and 0 as less following the method on \"Accounting for forest condition in Europe based on an international statistical standard\" by Maes et al.\r\nThis resource was created with GUIDOS toolbox. Starting with the Corine account layers, after reclassifying the values to fit into a byte-type raster, a reclassification was done for Nodata = 0, Agriculture = 1, Natural = 2, Developed = 3. Continuous, GWB_LM is derived to Landscape Mosaic and finally reclassifies the values to recode the pixel-values of the 103-class version of LM into 12 clases.",
