Starting with the Corine account layers, after reclassifying the values to fit into a byte-type raster, a reclassification was done for Nodata = 0, Agriculture = 1, Natural = 2, Developed = 3. Continuous, GWB_LM is derived to Landscape Mosaic and finally reclassifies the values to recode the pixel-values of the 103-class version of LM into 12 clases.\r\n",
