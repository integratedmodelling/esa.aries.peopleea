    "dc:comment" : "Given a year and area of interest, returns an annual mean composite of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) absorbed by the canopy. The FAPAR value results directly from the radiative transfer model in the canopy which is computed instantaneously. It depends on canopy structure, vegetation element optical properties and illumination conditions. To coincide with the models in which it is used, the product definition should correspond to the daily integrated FAPAR value that can be approached by computation of the clear sky daily integrated FAPAR values as well as the FAPAR value computed for diffuse conditions. To improve the consistency with other FAPAR products that are sometimes considering the instantaneous FAPAR value at the time of the satellite overpass under clear sky conditions (e.g. MODIS), a study was proposed to investigate the differences between alternative FAPAR definitions (Baret et al. 2003). Results show that the instantaneous FAPAR value at 10:00 (or 14:00) local solar time is very close to the daily integrated value under clear sky conditions. FAPAR is relatively linearly related to reflectance values, and will be little sensitive to scaling issues. Note also that the FAPAR refers only to the green parts (leaf chlorophyll content higher than 15μg.cm-2) of the canopy.",
