    "dc:comment": "The CDI is an indicator for drought early warning, specifically designed to monitor agricultural\n drought. Through the combination of spatial patterns of precipitation, soil moisture and greenness\n vegetation anomalies, the CDI identifies areas at risk of agricultural drought, areas where the\n vegetation has already been affected by drought and areas in the process of recovery to normal\n conditions. Accordingly, the CDI classification scheme defines three primary drought classes\n (\u201cWatch\u201d, \u201cWarning\u201d and \u201cAlert\u201d) and three recovery classes (\u201cTemporary Soil Moisture recovery\u201d,\n \u201cTemporary vegetation recovery\u201d and \u201cRecovery\u201d). The CDI version 2.0.0 (hereafter, v2) has been\n developed by Cammalleri et al. (2021), following the work of Sepulcre-Canto et al. (2012). The\n European Drought Observatory released the CDI v3 update in March 2023. This revision mainly\n benefits from the incorporation of time-varying crop masks, which prevent the use of the ALERT\n impact class (stress for vegetation) in crop areas out of the growing season.\n\n The resource has been adapted transforming the classes from 0 to 3, 0 meaning no drought, 1 watch,\n 2 warning and 3 Alert, into percentages:\n 0 = 1.0; 1 = 0.66; 2 = 0.33 and 3 = 0\n later, the average of all the 36 of all the timestamps for a pixel over the year.",
