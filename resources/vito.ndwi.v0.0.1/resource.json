    "dc:comment" : "Given a year and area of interest, returns the three-annual average of the Landsat NDWI generated on the GEE. These Landsat 8 Collection 1 Tier 1 composites are made from Tier 1 orthorectified scenes, using the computed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. It is derived from the Near-IR band and a second IR band, ≈1.24μm when available and the nearest available IR band otherwise. It ranges in value from -1.0 to 1.0. These composites are created from all the scenes in each 32-day period beginning from the first day of the year and continuing to the 352nd day of the year. The last composite of the year, beginning on day 353, will overlap the first composite of the following year by 20 days. All the images from each 32-day period are included in the composite, with the most recent pixel as the composite value.\r\n\r\nNDWI is processed in OpenEO (https://github.com/integratedmodelling/OpenEO-UDP-UDF-catalogue/blob/main/UDP/UDP_three_annual_average_NDWI.py). Given a year and an area of interest, the three-annual average of the Landsat NDWI generated on the GEE is returned.",
