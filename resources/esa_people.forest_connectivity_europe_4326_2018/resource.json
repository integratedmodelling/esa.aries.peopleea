    "dc:comment" : "Forest fragmentation of Europe represented in percentage with 100 as better condition and 0 as worse following the method on \"Accounting for forest condition in Europe based on an international statistical standard\" by Maes et al.\r\nIt was created with GUIDOS toolbox following the next steps. First, the Corine account layers were used after they were reclassified to fit into a byte-type raster. Later, a reclassification was done with the corresponding values:\r\n0, 48-50 (no data or unclassified) = 0 - Missing\r\n1 – 22, 26 – 44 (artificial, agriculture, wetlands) = 1 - Background\r\n23, 24, 25 (forests) = 2 - Foreground\r\nAs the layer is ready, the GWB_FRAG model was used to derive the forest connectivity into percentage.",
