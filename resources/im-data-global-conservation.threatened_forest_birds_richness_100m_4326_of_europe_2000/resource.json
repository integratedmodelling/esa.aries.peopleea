    "dc:comment" : "Spatial data on bird occurrences to build the species richness variable at European level for a representative time series are not freely/publicly available. Therefore, to cover this data gap, JRC developed a method to model the spatial patterns of bird species richness, making use of official reported data on bird distribution against a selected set of predictor variables. Modelling allows making projections over the full area of interest (Europe) and over time, for the years of interest 2000 and 2018.\r\nMethodology described in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39434-0.\r\nThe original dataset has a spatial resolution of 5km.\r\n\r\nthe model developed, as any modelling exercise, presents some limitations. For instance, this model is based on only certain variables that present common spatial pattern with species richness, but other key drivers of species richness might be missing. It is also important to mention that data derived from the European Breeding Bird Atlas (EBBA2) would be much more accurate for this exercise, but they are currently not publicly available.\r\nThe data has been resampled to 100m\r\n\r\n",
    "im:notes" : "Note that the shared dataset corresponds to the variable of species richness of threatened forest birds and it is therefore not a condition indicator. In this dataset, higher values do not necessarily imply a better condition. The condition indicator of species richness for threatened forest birds requires the rescaling making use of reference values (see paper). ",
