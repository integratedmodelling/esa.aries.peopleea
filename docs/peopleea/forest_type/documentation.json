    "template" : "## European Forest Type\r\nEuropean forests are classified analyzing the information from the Corine land cover dataset, used to distinguish varieties of forests, and the European bioregions dataset, to identify main ecological areas in Europe. Their combination, following the definition of Maes, J.et al. (2023) @cite(MaesEtAl2023), results in 44 forest types.\r\n\r\nThe following datasets were used to obtain this classification:\r\n* Forest landcovers from Corine year 2000 (vector file)@cite(corine.landcover.2000), \r\n* Corine accounting adjusted year 2000 (raster file)@cite(corine.landcover.accounts-adjusted.2000), and\r\n* European bioregion zones from the European Environement Agency catalogue of geospatial data sets@cite(EEA.european.bioregions).\r\n\r\n### Classes of European forests\r\nEuropean forests have been initially categorized based on their landcover forest class, as per the Corine dataset, which distinguishes 4 varieties of forest:\r\n1.\tBroad-leave forest@cite(corine.broadleave.forest),\r\n2.\tConiferous forest@cite(corine.coniferous.forest),\r\n3.\tMixed forest@cite(corine.mixed.forest),\r\n4.\tTransitional woodland & shrub@cite(corine.transitionalwoodland.and.shrub).\r\n\r\n### European bioregion zones\r\nThe classes of forest described above, are  combined with the information on the European bioregion zones, used to define 11 bioregions:\r\n1.\tAlpine,\r\n2.\tArctic,\r\n3.\tAtlantic,\r\n4.\tBlack Sea,\r\n5.\tBoreal,\r\n6.\tContinental,\r\n7.\tMacaronesian,\r\n8.\tMediterranean,\r\n9.\tPannonian,\r\n10.\tSteppic regions\r\n11.\tAlpine (Scandinavia)\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavian Alpine zone was differentiate from the rest of the Alpine bioregion for its characteristics, and covers the forest in the Scandinavian mountains on the border between Norway and Sweden.",
