    "template" : "## European Forest Type\r\nFollowing the definition of Maes, J.et al. (2023) @cite(MaesEtAl2023), the combination the information from the Corine dataset, used to distinguish the type of forests, and the European bioregions, used to ideintify different ecological areas in Europe, results in 44 forest types.\r\n\r\nThe following datasets were used to obtain this classification:\r\n* Forest landcovers from Corine year 2000 (vector file)@cite(corine.landcover.2000), \r\n* Corine accounting adjusted year 2000 (raster file)@cite(corine.landcover.accounts-adjusted.2000), and\r\n* European bioregion zones@cite(european.bioregions).\r\n\r\n### Classes of European forests\r\nEuropean forests have been initially categorized based on their landcover forest class, as per the Corine dataset, which distinguishes 4 types of forest:\r\n1.\tBroad-leave forest (311)@cite(broadleave.forest.corine),\r\n2.\tConiferous forest (312)@cite(corine.coniferous.forest),\r\n3.\tMixed forest (313)@cite(corine.mixed.forest),\r\n4.\tTransitional woodland & shrub (324)@cite(corine.transitionalwoodland.and.shrub).\r\n\r\n### European bioregion zones\r\nSuch categories of forest were also combined with the information on the European bioregion zones, used to define 11 bioregions:\r\n1.\tAlpine,\r\n2.\tArctic,\r\n3.\tAtlantic,\r\n4.\tBlack Sea,\r\n5.\tBoreal,\r\n6.\tContinental,\r\n7.\tMacaronesian,\r\n8.\tMediterranean,\r\n9.\tPannonian,\r\n10.\tSteppic regions\r\n11.\tAlpine (Scandinavia)\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavian Alpine zone was differentiate from the rest of the Alpine bioregion for its characteristics, and covers the forest in the Scandinavian mountains on the border between Norway and Sweden.",
